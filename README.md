# dotfiles

Awesome sauce for my dev machine

This repository stores all my dotfiles (e.g. `.emacs`) and makes use of [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage them on my system.

To get all the dotfiles installed on a new machine, I can simply (deep) clone this repository and run `./install` at the top-level (or wherever the `install.conf.yaml` file is).
